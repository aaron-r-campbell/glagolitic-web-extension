This Firefox extension replaces Latin alphabet characters with Glagolitic characters in the browser, allowing users to practice reading Glagolitic script. The extension provides character recognition practice, as pronunciation may differ slightly.

## Installation

You can install the Glagolitic Web extension from the official Firefox Add-ons website. Visit the following link: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/glagolitic-web](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/glagolitic-web)

## Usage

To toggle between Glagolitic and Latin alphabets, press the key command `Alt + Shift + 8`. This key combination switches the displayed text on the webpage to Glagolitic characters, and pressing it again will switch back to the original Latin alphabet.

## Known Bugs

- Occasionally, the translation may become mixed up or display incorrectly. In such cases, it is recommended to reload the webpage to restore proper functionality.

## To-Do

- Fix the bug causing mixed up or incorrect translations.
- Add a phonetic translation mode for improved pronunciation practice.
- Implement a settings menu to allow users to define custom shortcuts or adjust other preferences.
